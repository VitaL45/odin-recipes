    <h1>Dosa Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/images/Dosa.jpg" alt="Dosa" height="220" width="">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A dosa is a thin savory crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a 
        fermented batter of ground black lentils and rice. Dosas are served 
        hot, often with chutney and sambar. Dosas are popular in South Asia 
        as well as around the world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup idli rice <i>or parboiled rice or regular rice – 100 grams</i></li>
        <li>½ cup regular rice <i>– 100 grams</i></li>
        <li>¼ cup urad dal <i> – 50 grams (husked whole or split black gram)</i></li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds <i>or 2 pinches (methi seeds or methi dana)</i></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thick poha <i>(flattened rice)</i></li>
        <li>1.5 cups water <i> – for soaking both rice and lentils</i></li>
        <li>¾ cup water <i>– for grinding, do add water as required</i></li>
        <li>½ teaspoon rock salt <i>edible and food grade or non-iodized salt or 
            sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt</i></li>
        <li>oil as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><h3>Soaking lentils and Rice</h3></li>
         <ol>
            <li>In a bowl take the idli rice or parboiled rice along with 
                the regular white rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you
                can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I
                have shown in the video. The video has the recipe ingredients
                doubled in proportion.</li>
            <li>To the same bowl, add urad dal and fenugreek seeds.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple 
                of times and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, take the flattened rice.</li>
            <li>Rinse it once or twice in water and then add rinsed 
                flattened rice to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi 
                seeds.</li>
            <li>Pour 1.5 cups water. Mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 
                5 to 6 hours.</li>
         </ol>
       <li><h3>Making Dosa Batter</h3></li> 
        <ol>
            <li>Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients in a wet 
                grinder jar.</li>
            <li>Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency
                of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of batter is also fine. </li>
            <li>If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some 
                minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again. Depending
                on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two 
                batches. I ground in two batches and added overall ¾ cup 
                water.</li> 
            <li>Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan.</li>
            <li>Add ½ tsp rock salt. Mix very well. Cover and allow to 
                ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. Time of fermentation will 
                vary depending on the temperature conditions.</li>
            <li>A proper fermentation will double or triple up the volume of 
                the batter and you will see tiny air pockets in the batter 
                with a light sour aroma.</li>
            <li>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.</li>
        </ol>
       <li><h3>Making Dosa</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to 
                ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Do keep the heat on low to 
                low-medium heat, so that you are easily able to spread the 
                batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame 
                to medium.</li>
            <li>Do not spread oil if you are using a non stick pan, as you 
                won’t be able to spread the batter.</li>
            <li>Now take a ladle full of the batter. Pour the dosa batter 
                and gently spread the batter starting from the center and 
                moving outwards.</li>
            <li>Cover it with a lid and cook the dosa on a low to medium 
                heat. Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness.</li>
            <li>When you see the batter on the top has cooked well and the 
                bottom has become crisp and golden, then sprinkle ¼ to ½ 
                teaspoon oil on the edges and center.</li>
            <li>With the spoon spread the oil on the dosa.</li>
            <li>Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. The base will
                leave the pan and the sides will also get separated when it 
                gets cooked.</li>
            <li>Fold and serve sada dosa hot. Make all dosai this way.</li>
            <li>Serve these crisp plain dosa with sambar or potato masala 
                or coconut chutney.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
